# Feature Request

## Goal

Explain the **goal** of this feature request. Focus on the problem that needs to be solved and not on a particular solution. For example: "Make it easier for users to reset their passwords."

## Description

Provide as much background as the developer needs to implement the feature. Include screenshots, excerpts from emails, and links to other issues or pull requests as needed.

## Success Criteria

How would a stakeholder test whether the feature was completed or not?
